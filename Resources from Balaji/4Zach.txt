1906 - 2020 Monthly Flows
https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/NaturalFlow/current.html


-Compute Spring flows at each gauge 
- Restrict to Upper Basin
(Apr-Jun) total flows
-divide by 10^6 to get them in MAF (Million Acre-Feet)

(Apr-Jun) 1906 to (Apr-Jun) 2020

  l
-Run the commands in Cmds-4Zach.R
It will provide winter (Dec-Feb) average SSTs
for the period

(Dec-Feb) 1906 to (Dec-Feb) 2020
(Dec 1905 - Feb 1906 average...)

----------

- Perform SOM on the winter SSTs
- For each each SOM node select the streamflows at the upper basin gauges
You can even select handful - Lees Ferry, San Juan, Gunnison, Green,
Yampa and Glenwood (six locagions)

- Display the flows at each gauge as boxplots 
For each node you will have six boxpolots  in one figure

---
Looking at the flow boxplots and the SST patterns of the nodes you can 
infer the patterns that produce high/low flows.
--

Perform PCA on the SSTs.
-Use the first ~4 PCS and predict flows at Lees Ferry

and/or

USe the 4 PCs to predict at the 6 locations simultaneously
using CCA. If you do this,  you don't have to do a PC on the flows,
as they are only 6 of them. 4 PCS to predict 6 flows should be fine
in CCA

Use any other forecasting method - CART/Random Forest
